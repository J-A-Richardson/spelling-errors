Both pieces of text contain numerous spelling errors. Our task will be to correct those errors using commits in a separate branch,
then to merge the changes into the `master` branch.

2. Create a new branch in your forked repository and name it something descriptive like `spelling-corrections`
3. Find as many spelling errors as you can and use the online editor to correct them in your new branch.
4. Create a Pull Request within your own fork.
5. Review your changes in your pull request. Have you missed any spelling errors?
6. Invite a collaborator to double-check your work
7. Merge your pull-request
